## Hey there,

I am S. Kaan Cetindag, and this is a website I created to share and document some of the projects I did. I am intersted in machine learning in neuroscience, so I hope to do some research/literature review and maybe post some here. 

I did my B.Sc. in Koc University Electrics and Electronics Engineering and currently I am doing my M.Sc. Biomedical Engineering in Istanbul Technical University(ITU), meanwhile working in Electro-optic Devices Laboratory[(EDL)](http://edl.itu.edu.tr/).


I am also a director in a spatially-independent interdisciplinary virtual academic institution called Hall of the Sorcerer [(HotS)](https://www.hallofthesorcerer.com/).
