## Hey there,

I am S. Kaan Cetindag, and this is a website I created to share and document my thoughts and some of the projects I did. Currently not much is here, but I plan to post stuff in here fairly often. I am intersted in machine learning in neuroscience, so I hope to do some research/literature review and maybe post some here. 

I did my bachelors in Koc University Electrics and Electronics Engineering and currently I am doing my masters degree in Istanbul technical University(ITU) in biomedical engineering, working in Electro-optic devices Laboratory plus I work/tinker as a part-time-freelance hardware engineer, doing personal/custom electronics solutions.
